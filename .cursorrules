# TeamConnect Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is TeamConnect - a Smart Team Collaboration Platform with real-time messaging, task management, video calls, and more.

## Project Structure
- `client/` - React frontend (TypeScript, Vite, Material-UI)
- `server/` - Node.js backend (Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, Socket.io)
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and utilities

## Coding Standards

### General
- Always use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Frontend (client/)
- Use React 18+ with functional components and hooks
- Prefer Material-UI components when available
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions
- Ensure responsive design for all UI components
- Use TypeScript interfaces from `shared/` for type definitions
- Use Framer Motion for animation effects when needed, following the visual and motion guidelines in `Deisgn.json`

### Backend (server/)
- Use Express.js with TypeScript
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Use Mongoose for MongoDB operations
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use JWT for authentication
- Use Socket.io for real-time features
- Keep business logic in service layers, not in routes

### Shared Types
- Define shared TypeScript interfaces in `shared/` directory
- Keep types consistent across frontend and backend
- Export types for reuse in both client and server

## Security Guidelines
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS in production

## Testing
- When fixing a bug, always address the root cause; implement a permanent solution rather than a temporary patch.
- When adding a new feature, ensure it is thoroughly tested—including manual browser testing—before merging.
- All changes and new tests must not break existing features or functionality.
- Write tests for all critical functionality.
- Maintain test coverage wherever feasible.
- Test both successful and error scenarios for each feature or fix.

## Git & Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow branching strategy as defined in project
- Don't commit generated files or dependencies

## Documentation
- Keep documentation as short and clear as possible—include only required info
- Update docs when you make changes
- Only document APIs and features as needed for understanding and usage

## Important Notes
- Always check existing code before implementing new features
- Maintain consistency with the current tech stack
- Consider performance implications of code changes
- Ensure backward compatibility when modifying existing APIs


- Always maintain and regularly update the `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` file in the project root. This document tracks all major features, indicating which are implemented, working, broken, or planned (high/low priority). 
- When adding, modifying, or removing a feature, make sure the corresponding section in `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` accurately reflects the current project status.
- Use consistent formatting and detailed descriptions for each feature to ensure clarity for all collaborators.

- Follow the visual and UX guidance described in `Deisgn.json` for all UI and design decisions. Ensure colors, typography, spacing, component shapes, and motion align with the definitions and principles in that file.


- Maintain a clean and organized codebase at all times.
- Regularly review and remove unused code, imports, variables, and dependencies.
- Ensure all submitted code adheres to industry-level coding standards and best practices (naming, structure, documentation, etc.).
